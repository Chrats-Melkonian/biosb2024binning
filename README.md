# Metagenomics Binning Workshop

Welcome to the Metagenomics Binning Workshop! This repository contains materials, scripts, and instructions for learning how to bin metagenomic data into high-quality genome bins. In this workshop, we will explore the various tools and methods used for metagenomic binning and assembly of microbial genomes from complex environments.

## Workshop Overview
Metagenomics binning is a key step in reconstructing genomes from microbial communities, allowing researchers to study unculturable microorganisms. In this workshop, you will:
- Understand the principles of metagenomic binning.
- Use popular tools such as `MetaBAT`, `MaxBin`, and `CONCOCT`.
- Evaluate the quality of genome bins with tools like `CheckM` and `QUAST`.

The workshop includes hands-on exercises with real metagenomic datasets and step-by-step guidance on binning strategies.

## Prerequisites
Participants should have:
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line.
- A working installation of `conda` or `mamba`.
- Some familiarity with metagenomics data formats (e.g., FASTQ, FASTA).

For participants new to bioinformatics, we recommend reviewing a basic [command-line tutorial](https://www.learnshell.org/) before the workshop.
