# Metagenomics Binning Workshop

Welcome to the Metagenomics Binning Workshop from Computational Metagenomics (BioSB Advanced course)! This repository contains materials, scripts, and instructions for learning how to bin metagenomic data into high-quality genome bins. In this workshop, we will explore the various tools and methods used for metagenomic binning and assembly of microbial genomes from complex environments.

## Workshop Overview
Metagenomics binning is a key step in reconstructing genomes from microbial communities, allowing researchers to study unculturable microorganisms. In this workshop, you will:

- Understand the principles of metagenomic binning.
- Learn how to quality control, filter and pre-process raw megaenomics reads.
- Assembly your reads to contigs with popular tools, such as `MEGAHIT`.
- Use popular tools such for binning such as `MetaBAT`.
- Evaluate the quality of asseblies and genome bins with tools like `CheckM` and `QUAST`.

The workshop includes hands-on exercises with real metagenomic datasets and step-by-step guidance on a simple binning apporch.

## Introduction
Dataset explanation:

- In this practical session, you will process raw sequencing reads to achieve taxonomic characterization of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).
- For this experiment, we have collected two samples from a toxic biofilm in a Romanian cave that emits greenhouse gases, along with one methane-enriched sample from the lab.
- Your task is to identify the community members capable of methane consumption and the associated gene clusters responsible for this process.

## Datasets
For this workshop, we will use publicly available metagenomics datasets with the following command:
	```bash
	wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/run/ERR100/ERR10036470/*

The datasets from their respective sources or from the provided links in the `datasets/` folder.
